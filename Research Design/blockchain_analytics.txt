Project Plan
- Collect your list of questions and categorize them from an impact/effort
  perspective. Rank order the two of them to figure out which questions to answer.
- Create a list of QA requirements for the different data definitions and begin
  to fix the data.
- Define the tables and datasets you would need to answer each of your questions
  based on the questions you asked. Do not worry about having to many or few,
  or even having some of them just as scripts. We don't care to have this be
  part of a pipeline.
- Execute on this, reload the data into redshift, get the data out that you need
  and then have the data just ready to go without needing redshift. Have a
  generic dataset for Taylor to play around in.
- Visualize in Quicksight for ease of use, or use excel or some other datasource
  for my uses.
