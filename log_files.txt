Brian Notes 1/1/2018
Going through this now and coming up with a plan to add a bunch of data.
I have added the following folders for structure:
- Datamart (Where the logic for the Datamart Stucture goes)
- ETL (Where the ETL Logic goes)
- Nodes (Where the logic for creating the blockchain data nodes exist)
This should be enough to get us started.
I am going to start with Bitcoin and use a publically available API to start
building our ETL. After I get that settled, I will go and create a Datamart.

Future Question: We will be getting a fuck ton of different datetime stamps
and will need to convert them to some standard format across the board. What
timestamp will be best for this?
