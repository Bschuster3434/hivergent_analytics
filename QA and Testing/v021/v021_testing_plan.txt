Found Bugs:
1
KIN Token is not getting valued correctly from a USD perspective.
-- Seems that there are a collection of cryptocurrencies that are inaccurately
-- categorized. I will go through the dataset and clean those as need.

Error Identification and Process
- Checking the smart contract table where $ values are made for each token.
- My gut is that the values were incorrect there and need to be manually
- Fixed for each identified to be wrong.

- Seems that there are some wildly inaccurate $'s here. I will be fixing these
- values using CoinMarketCap estimates for that day.

- Data will be fixed, then reloaded into the datamart via S3 upload and truncate
- and reload.

- After that, this dataset needs to be reloaded. In order for the change to take
- place, the cross transaction table needs to be truncated and the data reloaded
- into it. That can happen later.

How is this possible?

2 'SmartContractHash' Not included and used in the dataset
I want to add Smart Contract Hash and that data in the most efficient way possible.
I think that is I just create a separate table and load just the ethereum
table into that, I'll be able to create the script I'm looking for.

- Alter Transform Script to include that new data
- Re-run the transform script to include this new data
- Upload the data into S3
- Run the Ethereum Reload Scripts
- New SQL Script for Creation of dataset
- Confirm SQL Load will not be impacted
- Insert and load new data
- Create the next insert script into factEthereumTransactionsTable
- Load Data into quicksight

3 Ripple Currency Values might be inaccurate
Found a transaction "28FD2E1ED0DEAB80C835B25577054367ACC790F0B7773C2966C9E1CA5020C264"
Where someone traded BTC for BTC, but it's not real BTC, because they sent
20,000,000 of it.

Seems that there are a few transactions that have some funny business, but
nothing that makes me think that this is a deal breaker. I'll add the additional
datasets and see how that works.

After reviewing the data, the process is not incorrect. It just seems that there
are some significant outliers that are screwing with my data.
