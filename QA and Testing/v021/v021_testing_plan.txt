Found Bugs:
1
KIN Token is not getting valued correctly from a USD perspective.
-- Seems that there are a collection of cryptocurrencies that are inaccurately
-- categorized. I will go through the dataset and clean those as need.

Error Identification and Process
- Checking the smart contract table where $ values are made for each token.
- My gut is that the values were incorrect there and need to be manually
- Fixed for each identified to be wrong.

- Seems that there are some wildly inaccurate $'s here. I will be fixing these
- values using CoinMarketCap estimates for that day.

- Data will be fixed, then reloaded into the datamart via S3 upload and truncate
- and reload.

- After that, this dataset needs to be reloaded. In order for the change to take
- place, the cross transaction table needs to be truncated and the data reloaded
- into it. That can happen later.

How is this possible?

Found a transaction "28FD2E1ED0DEAB80C835B25577054367ACC790F0B7773C2966C9E1CA5020C264"
Where someone traded BTC for BTC, but it's not real BTC, because they sent
20,000,000 of it.

Seems that there are a few transactions that have some funny business, but
nothing that makes me think that this is a deal breaker. I'll add the additional
datasets and see how that works.
